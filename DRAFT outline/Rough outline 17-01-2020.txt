Regardless of whether the game is one the command line or online, we will need the following (this is essentially the Model)

Initialise:
	create Deck and populate from text file
		shuffle the Deck
		create CommunalPile object to hold cards in the event of a draw
	create (human) player
	ask for number of opponents and create AI players	
	"deal" - split Deck object and pass cards to each player's hand
		if there are 3 players (so 40 cards cannot be evenly divided between them) add the remaining cards to the CommunalPile (maybe need a boolean flag to determine whether CommunalPile has anything in it)

Gameplay:
	Decide on starting player
	ArrayList of active players(?)
	While loop - if there is more than one active player, continue
		Pick an attribute (either human input or AI using Random number generation)
		Compare to all other active cards
		Decide winner
		Redistribute cards to the winning player (including any from CommunalPile if applicable)
